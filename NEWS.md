# taxodist 0.1.0

* Initial release
* Compute taxonomic distances between any two taxa using The Taxonomicon
* Session-level caching for lineage data to minimize network requests
* Functions: `taxo_distance()`, `mrca()`, `distance_matrix()`, `closest_relative()`,
  `compare_lineages()`, `shared_clades()`, `is_member()`, `filter_clade()`,
  `lineage_depth()`, `check_coverage()`, `clear_cache()`

# taxodist 0.2.0

## New functions

* `taxo_cluster()`: hierarchical clustering of taxa by taxonomic distance.
* `taxo_ordinate()`: ordination (PCoA) of taxa in taxonomic distance space.
* `save_cache()`: serialises the session lineage cache to an `.rds` file.
* `load_cache()`: restores a previously saved cache, avoiding redundant network requests.
* `taxo_path()`: returns the full node-by-node path between two taxa as a
  tidy data frame, ascending from taxon A to their MRCA and descending to
  taxon B.

## Documentation

* Added a new vignette (`Statistical Applications of taxodist`) demonstrating 
  the integration of `taxodist` with `ape` (tree plotting) and `vegan` 
  (taxonomic distinctness, Mantel tests, and PERMANOVA).

## Minor improvements

* Added `vegan` to `Suggests` in `DESCRIPTION`.
* Documented the compatibility of `distance_matrix()` output with `vegan` 
  functions (`taxondive()`, `mantel()`, `adonis2()`).
* Documented the conversion of `taxo_cluster()` results into `phylo` objects 
  using `ape::as.phylo()`.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed incorrect MRCA computation caused by unnamed crown nodes (`[crown]`)
  being matched across different lineages as if they were the same ancestor.
* Fixed parsing of Taxonomicon rank prefixes (`Cohort`, `Subcohort`, 
  `Magnorder`, `Grandorder`, `Parvorder`, `Legion`) that were being retained 
  as bare rank names instead of the actual clade names (e.g., `Placentalia`, 
  `Boreoeutheria`, `Galloanserae`).
  
# taxodist 0.3.0

## New features
* `taxo_search()`: Added a new interactive search function that queries The Taxonomicon and         returns a tidy data frame of all available IDs, ranks, and authors for a given taxon name.
* Direct ID Support: `get_lineage()` and all distance functions (e.g.,                             `taxo_distance()`, `distance_matrix()`) now accept Taxonomicon numeric IDs. This                 provides a fallback for computing distances when homonyms or historical ranks cannot be          disambiguated by name alone.

## Network Handling
* Added a 30-second timeout to all HTTP requests to prevent the R session from hanging             indefinitely when The Taxonomicon servers are overloaded.
* Network failures, offline servers, or bad HTTP statuses now immediately emit a clear,            informative warning to the user rather than failing silently.

## Bug fixes
* Extended rank-prefix filter to remove additional bare rank tokens that were
  being retained as spurious lineage nodes: `Subgenus`, `Section`, `Division`,
  `Subdivision`, `Supercohort`, `Infracohort`, `Subsection`, `Candidatus`,
  `Parvphylum`, `Branch`, and `Go to` (a navigation artefact from The
  Taxonomicon page layout).
* Duplicate lineage nodes originating from data-quality issues in The
  Taxonomicon (e.g. `Uropygi` appearing twice in Thelyphonida, `Myxomycetes`
  appearing twice in Physarum) are now collapsed to a single occurrence.
  A warning is emitted when deduplication occurs so the user is aware of the
  upstream data issue.
* `get_taxonomicon_id()` now collects all biological matches for a taxon name
  before returning, and emits a warning when multiple valid biological entries
  are found in The Taxonomicon. This surfaces homonym ambiguity (e.g. `Nereis`
  matching both a polychaete worm and a butterfly genus) that was previously
  silent.
* `get_taxonomicon_id()` now properly follows taxonomic redirects and removes interface            noise (`N|T|P...`) from warnings.
* When multiple biological entries are found (e.g. `Bacteria`), the warning now lists all          available numeric IDs without duplicates, allowing users to make an informed choice.
* Made lineage parsing more robust by strictly truncating any philosophical or pre-basal           nodes (e.g. `organisms`) appearing before `Biota`.
* Added validation to `get_lineage_by_id()` to silently return `NULL` for non-numeric              strings, preventing upstream server fallback errors.
* Fixed a lineage parsing issue where the parent `Genus` was erroneously truncated from            species-level queries. Distances and Most Recent Common Ancestors (MRCAs) between congeneric     species are now computed accurately.
* Fixed an issue where taxonomic author names enclosed in double quotes (e.g., `"Redtenbacher,     1906"`) were evading the lineage cleaning pipeline and being erroneously retained as part of     the clade name.

# taxodist 0.4.0

## New features

* `cache_info()`: inspects the current session cache, reporting the number of
  cached lineages and IDs, total memory used, and the names of all taxa whose
  lineages are stored. Returns a named list invisibly for programmatic use.
* `focal_distances()`: computes taxonomic distances from a single focal taxon
  to all members of a community vector. Returns a sorted data frame with
  columns `taxon`, `distance`, `mrca`, and `mrca_depth`, making it easy to
  identify the closest and most distant relatives of a focal species in a
  community context.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed a lineage parsing bug where taxa with `Subphylum` and `Infraphylum`
  rank prefixes (e.g., Craniata, Vertebrata) were being incorrectly discarded.
  The dagger symbol (`†`) is now stripped before rank prefixes are removed,
  ensuring that prefixed names like `Subphylum † Craniata` are correctly
  parsed to `Craniata` rather than falling through as bare rank tokens.
  `Subphylum` and `Infraphylum` have been removed from `bare_ranks` accordingly.
* Fixed parsing of `auct.` author annotations (e.g., `Subphylum Craniata auct.`)
  that were preventing rank-prefixed names from being correctly cleaned.
* Fixed intermediate clades being silently dropped from lineages when their
  author strings contained ampersands, hyphens (e.g., Cavalier-Smith), or
  trailing commas without a year (e.g., `Romeriida Gauthier,`). The author
  removal pipeline now handles these patterns correctly.
* Fixed a bug where the dagger extinction marker (`†`) appearing between a
  rank prefix and a taxon name (e.g., `Family † Dromaeosauridae`) caused the
  taxon to be lost entirely. Dagger removal now precedes all other cleaning
  steps.
  
# taxodist 0.5.0

## New features

* `taxobase`: Added a built-in reference dataset containing 50 taxonomic clades. 
   The dataset includes pre-computed distance matrices, lineage paths, search 
   outputs, and coverage vectors. It acts as a complete offline fallback, allowing 
   package examples, vignettes, and unit tests to run instantly without requiring 
   a network connection to The Taxonomicon.

## Bug fixes

  * Fixed a bug where any taxon whose name contains the substring "planet" (e.g.               *Periplaneta*) was incorrectly discarded by the astronomical homonym filter in               `get_taxonomicon_id()` and `taxo_search()`. The filter now uses word boundaries              (`\bplanet\b`) so that genus names containing "planet" as an infix are no longer mistakenly   treated as non-biological entries.
  * Fixed a lineage parsing bug affecting genera whose Taxonomicon page does not link back to   the genus itself (e.g. *Periplaneta*, which only links to its constituent species). The      lineage is now correctly truncated before child species entries, and the genus name is       appended if absent.
  * Added `"Epifamily"` to the bare rank token filter so that unprefixed rank labels are not   retained as spurious lineage nodes.
  * Fixed a lineage parsing bug where the superscript type-marker `ᵀ` (U+1D40) immediately     following a taxon name prevented word-boundary matching in the cutoff search, causing the    lineage to overshoot the target node and incorrectly include descendant taxa as ancestors.   This silently affected any type genus or type species (i.e. the majority of genera), and     was particularly visible in deep clades such as *Dinosauria* where several child clades      were being parsed as ancestor nodes. Higher-rank taxa (clades, orders, families — anything   above genus level) were disproportionately affected.
  * Fixed a lineage parsing bug where navigation header text prepended to the                  `#divPageContent` block could contain the target taxon name (e.g. in a cited reference       title), causing the lineage cutoff to land in the junk header rather than the actual         taxonomic tree. Affected taxa received a garbage two- or three-line lineage and were         silently discarded by the `"Biota"` membership check in `get_taxonomicon_id()`.              *Drosophila* (the fly genus, ID 28940) was one such case.

# taxodist 0.6.0

## Breaking changes

* The distance definition is now a proper ultrametric. Distance is zero only
  when two complete lineages identify the same hierarchy node. Distinct
  ancestor-descendant pairs now receive `1 / depth(MRCA)` instead of zero.
  Use `is_member()` or `taxo_path()` when the question concerns clade
  membership or containment rather than distance between nodes.
* Package terminology now consistently describes the measure as a taxonomic
  hierarchy distance rather than a phylogenetic distance.

## Data and documentation

* `taxobase` is now distributed as a single documented list with provenance
  metadata, a compact reference distance matrix, and an offline matrix used to
  build the statistical applications vignette reproducibly.
* Added a methodological vignette defining the distance, demonstrating its
  ultrametric property, and documenting its assumptions and limitations.
* Revised the introduction and statistical applications vignettes to remove
  stale hand-written numerical output and distinguish taxonomic dendrograms
  from inferred phylogenetic trees.
* Added a package citation for taxodist and a separate citation for The
  Taxonomicon data source.

## Bug fixes and robustness

* MRCA detection now uses only the continuous common lineage prefix, preventing
  repeated names after divergence from being mistaken for shared ancestry.
* `is_member()` now performs exact, case-insensitive matching and treats regular
  expression characters literally.
* `taxo_path()` now correctly handles identical taxa, ancestor-descendant pairs,
  path direction, lineage depths, and pairs with no common ancestor.
* Empty and single-taxon inputs are handled safely by distance matrices,
  clustering, ordination, heatmaps, closest-relative queries, and focal
  distances. Ordination also reduces `k` when required by sample size.
* Clustering, ordination, and heatmaps now detect `NA` and infinite distances
  and return informative fallback objects instead of failing downstream.
* `load_cache()` validates cache structure, names, and value types before
  modifying the active cache.
